        <h4>Our Mission</h4>
        <p2>
            According to Newsweek, 84 percent of all unwanted clothes end up in landfills,
             and the volume of clothing Americans throw away each year has doubled in the
             last 20 years, from 7 million to 14 million tons. We are constantly being mindful
             about making less of an environmental impact. We are looking at everything
             we can do to see if we can be using more sustainable materials,
             reduce waste and work more efficiently. We want to help each individual
             play their part in fashion, from advocating for thrifting to transforming
             their previous clothing into new styles.
